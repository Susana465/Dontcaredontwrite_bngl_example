# Dontcaredontwrite example
This is a repository which shows a simple model of A, B,C molecules that it helpful for understanding the "don't care, don't write" capacity of rule based modelling.

**Click on the link to see the BNGL code, which can be copy/pasted into a .bngl file in an editor or RuleBender.**

- You can see the model by looking at the [`simple_dcdw.bngl`](simple_dcdw.bngl)

- You can run the model and look at results using the [`PyBNG.ipynb`](PyBNG.ipynb)

Additional material on how BioNetGen works as well as different models can be found here: [BNGTutorial](https://github.com/RuleWorld/BNGTutorial/)
