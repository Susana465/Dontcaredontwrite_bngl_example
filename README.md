# Dontcaredontwrite example
This is a repository which shows a simple model of A, B,C molecules that it helpful for understanding the "don't care, don't write" capacity of rule based modelling.

**Click on the link to:**

- See the models by looking at the ode or ssa simulations [`ode_simple_dcdw.bngl`](ode_simple_dcdw.bngl)[`ssa_simple_dcdw.bngl`](ssa_simple_dcdw.bngl)

- Run the models and look at results using the [`PyBNG.ipynb`](PyBNG.ipynb)
